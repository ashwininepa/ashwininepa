## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ashwini ðŸ˜ƒ

I am a Data Scientist and passionate about Machine Learning, Containerization of applications, GCP, achieving CI/CD using TeamCity at work and taught myself GitHub Actions off-work which is very fascinating. I have recently explored working with LLMs - vertexai and openai libraries from Python. I like unit testing, TDD. I use Git for version control and mindful about the commits. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LLMs, Data Pipelines, BI Porduct, MLOps, Data Analytics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing courses from Google Cloud Skills Boost on Machine Learning Engineer Path
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, GenerativeAI, MLOps, Data Analytics
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on my LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like gardening, I have 26 plants and have succeeded to flourish them during long and dark winter.
